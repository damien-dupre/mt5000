# So Far in MT5000

#### We have seen the basics of SQL queries (Lecture/Tutorial 1)

While mastering the basics of SQL is important to have the mandatory requirement of most business analytics positions...

... Don't spend too much time in knowing advanced SQL functions because R (and Python) can do it better

`r anicon::faa("hand-point-right", animate="horizontal")` Advice: Use free learning content to practice SQL ([check here for list of 25 websites offering free SQL tutorials `r fontawesome::fa("link")`](https://skillcrush.com/blog/learn-sql-online/ ))

# So Far in MT5000

#### We have seen advanced functions in MS Excel (Lecture/Tutorial 2)

As much as I hate Excel, it is and will remain an essential tool in low/med tech organisations.

It wouldn't be considered as a faux pas in CVs for business analytics positions, using "Advanced Excel" instead of only "Excel" would be advised.

`r anicon::faa("hand-point-right", animate="horizontal")` Advice: Value the use of Pivot Tables and VLOOKUP functions which are the most efficient tools in some organisations. To increase your knowledge even more, practising Excel VBA Macros would be the next step.

#### We have seen how to create dashboards with Tableau (Lecture/Tutorial 3 & 4)

Tableau is one of the highlight of the Module and should shine on your CV:
- In addition to SQL
- Showcase your work with Tableau Online (and use the links in your CV)
- Participate to visualisation challenges for "fortune and glory":
  - https://www.edhec.edu/en/edhec-dataviz-challenge-2021
  - https://womeninanalytics.com/data-viz-competition/
  - https://dvastudentchallenge.ca/
  - https://www.tableau.com/academic/student-Iron-Viz

`r anicon::faa("hand-point-right", animate="horizontal")` Advice: Don't underestimate the power of data story telling as well, [see the MBA’s Guide to Breaking Into Data Science `r fontawesome::fa("link")`](https://opendatascience.com/an-mbas-guide-to-breaking-into-data-science/)

# So Far in MT5000

#### We have seen how to create academic/scientific reports with Jamovi (Lecture/Tutorial 5, 6 & 7)

Technically, there is low chance that you would use that in the future ... 

... But knowing what is a linear regression and how to do it was very important in term of statistics applied to analytics (basics of economics and machine learning)

`r anicon::faa("hand-point-right", animate="horizontal")` Advice: Don't consider adding Jamovi in your CV but instead your proficiency in Statistics and Multivariate Linear Regressions.

# So Far in MT5000

#### We have seen R, RStudio and RMarkdown for academic/scientific reports (Lecture/Tutorial 8, 9, 10 & 11)

Basically, R replaces all the tools we have seen so far (free and more powerful).

`r anicon::faa("hand-point-right", animate="horizontal")` Advice: The more you know R, the nicest your life will be:

- Not spending hours in manual transformations
- Higher salary
- Satisfaction of being a kind of hacker
