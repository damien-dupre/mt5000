# R so far

We have already seen how to:

- `filter()`
- `select()`
- `mutate()`
- `summarise()` with `group_by()`

More importantly we have seen how to use the pipe `%>%` sign to chain multiple transformations.

Let's start to to make some fancy visualisations, after a last important thing!

---

# Disable Scientific Number Format

By __default R uses scientific number format__ to display values when they are too long, which usually append in visualisations.

For example `1000000` is printed as:

```{r echo=FALSE}
format(1000000, scientific = TRUE)
```

To disable this scientific number format, include and __run the following code__ at the beginning of every script (ideally after loading the libraries) every time you restart R:

```{r}
options(scipen = 999)
```

Now, `1000000` is printed as:

```{r echo=FALSE}
1000000
```

And your visualisations will not use the scientific number format anymore

# Posit Cloud

In your webrowser (Chrome, Firefox, ...):

1. Open these same slides on a tab to copy-paste the examples
  - From Loop: Lectures > Lecture 10
  - Or from the URL: https://damien-dupre.github.io/mt5000/lectures/lecture_10

2. In another tab, go to: https://posit.cloud/
  - Sign in or Sign up (if not already done)
  - In your workspace, Click "Untitled Project" or "New Project" (if not already done)
  
`r faa("exclamation-triangle", animate="flash", speed="slow", color="red")` "New Project" is creating a fresh install, the packages will have to be re-installed

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
include_graphics("https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*JBHNRwGr3ZiyBzYWpvH6zg.png")
```

# The gapminder Dataset

The dataset used today is stored in the {gapminder} package into an object called `gapminder`. 

Each row in this table corresponds to a country at a specific year. For each row, we have 6 columns:

- **country**: Name of country.
- **year**: Year of the observation (between 1952 and 2007).
- **pop**: Number of people living in the country.
- **continent**: Which of the five continents the country is part of. 
- **lifeExp**: Life expectancy in years.
- **gdpPercap**: Gross domestic product (in US dollars).

```{r eval=FALSE}
#install.packages("gapminder")
library(gapminder)
str(gapminder)
```

# 1. Basic Visualistions with {ggplot2}

---

# Using {ggplot2} in the {tidyverse}

The {ggplot2} package, as it provides an **easy way to create and to customise your plots**.

As a part of the {tidyverse} package, {ggplot2} is loaded when {tidyverse} is loaded as well:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("tidyverse") if not done already (check list of packages)
library(tidyverse)
```

--

**“the grammar of graphics”** (the “gg” in ggplot) defines a set of rules for constructing statistical graphics by combining different types of layers. 

From the first (bottom) to the last (top), the mandatory layers are :

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
include_graphics("https://englelab.gatech.edu/useRguide/images/dataviz/ge_geom.png")
```

---

# Data

In {ggplot2}, the **data** layer is the name of the object that contains the variables to plot.

The visualisation is initiated with the function `ggplot()`

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = my_dataframe) # the argument name can be omitted too
```

--

Let's try to use the gapminder data:

```{r fig.height=2}
ggplot(data = gapminder) # or ggplot(gapminder)
```

Only a grey frame is displayed: we need to define the axes (aesthetic mapping) and their corresponding layers.

**Then additional, layers are added with the symbol `+`.**

---

# Aesthetic Mapping

The **aesthetic mapping** refers to the frame of the plot, `x` for the variable in the x-axis and `y` for the variable in the y-axis. There are many more aesthetics such as `color`, `fill` and `group` but let's focus on the x and y axes for the moment. The mapping is performed by a function in {ggplot2} called `aes()` for aesthetics. 

This is an essential concept to remember, the mapping of a plot (frame axes) is built from aesthetics.

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = my_dataframe) +
  aes(x = my_xaxis_variable, y = my_yaxis_variable)
```

--

Again, the arguments names of the `ggplot()` function and layers can be omitted if filled in the right order:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(my_dataframe) +
  aes(my_xaxis_variable, my_yaxis_variable)
```

Obviously, some type of layers are not suitable for all aesthetics, it depends on how many variables are included and their type (categorical or continuous). 

---

# Aesthetic Mapping

.pull-left[
**Aesthetic mapping represents** not only the variables defined as **x-axis** and **y-axis** but also, **colours** of borders (colors), colours of shapes (fill), **shapes**, **size**, ...
]

.pull-right[
```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = my_dataframe) +
 aes(
   x = my_xaxis_variable, 
   y = my_yaxis_variable,
   color = my_color_variable,
   fill = my_fill_variable,
   shape = my_shape_variable,
   size = my_size_variable
  )
```
]

--

For example, the following code is adding not only a x- and y-axis to a scatter plot, but also colours to the points:

.pull-left[
```{r aesthetic, fig.height=3, fig.show="hide"}
ggplot(data = gapminder) +
  aes(
    x = gdpPercap, 
    y = lifeExp, 
    color = continent
  )
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(fig_chunk("aesthetic", "png"))
```
]

---

# Geometries

**Geometries**, which are shapes we use to represent our data. There is a dedicated function for every type of shape to plot but all start with `geom_`

|function          |shape    |
|------------------|---------|
|`geom_point()`    |point    |
|`geom_line()`     |line     |
|`geom_bar()`      |bar      |
|`geom_histogram()`|histogram|
|`geom_boxplot()`  |boxplot  |
|...               |...      |

The list is very long but here are the main ones. Multiple **geometries** can be added as layers by using the same `+` symbol. 

---

# Geometries

Example for scatter plots:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = my_dataframe) +
  aes(x = my_xaxis_variable, y = my_yaxis_variable) +
  geom_point() 
```

Example for line graph:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = my_dataframe) +
  aes(x = my_xaxis_variable, y = my_yaxis_variable) +
  geom_line() 
```

Example for bar graph:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = my_dataframe) +
  aes(x = my_xaxis_variable, y = my_yaxis_variable) +
  geom_col() 
```

`r faa("arrow-circle-right", animate="horizontal", speed="slow", color="blue")` Note: Not all data is suitable for all types of geometries. You have to find the geometry that corresponds to your data.

---

# Geometries Applied to gapminder

Example for scatter plots:

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
ggplot(data = gapminder) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent) +
  geom_point() 
```

---

# Geometries Applied to gapminder

Example for line graph:

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
ggplot(data = gapminder) +
  aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = country) +
  geom_line() +
  guides(color ="none") # removes legend because too many countries
```

---

# Geometries Applied to gapminder

Example for bar graph:

```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=12}
gapminder_avg_continent_2007 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarise(m_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp))

ggplot(data = gapminder_avg_continent_2007) +
  aes(x = continent, y = m_lifeExp, fill = continent) +
  geom_col() 
```

## Exercise

Create:

- A `ggplot()` layer with the `gapminder` data,
- An `aes()` layer containing `continent` as x, `lifeExp` as y, and `continent` as color,
- And a `geom_boxplot()` layer:

```{r eval=FALSE}
_ _ _(_ _ _) +
  aes(x = _ _ _, y = _ _ _, color = _ _ _) +
  _ _ _()
```

- A `ggplot()` layer with the `gapminder` data,
- An `aes()` layer containing `year` as x, `pop` as y, and `continent` as fill,
- And a `geom_col()` layer:

```{r eval=FALSE}
_ _ _(_ _ _) +
  aes(x = _ _ _, y = _ _ _, fill = _ _ _)
  _ _ _()
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 5, warn_when = 60)
```

# 2. Advanced Visualistions with {ggplot2}

---

# Customising Plots

Take a look at the ggplot2 [cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf), and think of ways you could improve the plot.

<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/21d683072b0c21cbd9b41fc0e37a587ad26b9525/cbf41/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/data-visualization-2.1.png" width="75%">

---

# Inherited Propriety of Geometries

You can add as many geometry layers as you want, however repeating the mapping for each geometry layer is very redundant. 

Thankfully, if all your geometry layers are using the same aesthetics mapping, __it is possible to include this mapping inside the `ggplot()`__, then all the geometry layers will have the same mapping:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = country)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```

--

If aesthetics are different for several geometry layers, it is also __possible to declare the aesthetics in the geometry__:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, shape = continent)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = country))
```

---

# Themes

Now, to make the plot more professional, let's remove that standard grey background using a different theme. 

Many themes come built into the {ggplot2} package. My preference is `theme_bw()` but once you start typing `theme_` a list of options will pop up.

```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=12}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
```

---

# Themes

Built-in ggplot2 themes includes:

- `theme_bw()`
- `theme_classic()`
- `theme_minimal()`
- `theme_dark()`
- `theme_light()`
- ... 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
include_graphics("https://thinkr.fr/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ggplot-meme.jpg")
```

---

# Facets

Faceting is used to __split a particular visualisation by the values of another variable__. 

This will create multiple copies of the same type of plot with matching x and y axes, but whose content will differ.

For example, suppose we were interested in looking at the evolution of life expectancy by continent from 1952. We could “split” this figure for each continent. In other words, we would plot a scatter plot for each continent separately. 

We do this by adding `facet_wrap(~ continent)` layer.

---

# Facets

```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=12}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ continent) +
  theme_classic()
```

The tilde (`~`) can be read as "by". If not included, R will prompt the following  error:

```{r echo=FALSE, error=TRUE}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(continent) +
  theme_classic()
```

---

# Facets

We can also specify the number of rows and columns in the grid by using the `nrow` and `ncol` arguments inside of `facet_wrap()`. 

For example, suppose we would like our faceted figure to have 1 rows instead of 2. We simply add an `nrow = 1` argument to `facet_wrap(~ continent)`:

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=12}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, nrow = 1) +
  theme_classic()
```

---

# Labels

Ggplot has a layer called `labs()` in order to change the name of the axis labels very quickly. 

`labs()` has at least 3 arguments for us: x, y and title.

```{r fig.height=2, fig.width=12}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, nrow = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Year (from 1952 to 2007)",
    y = "Life Expectancy",
    title = "Evolution of life expectancy from 1952 to 2007 per continent."
  ) +
  theme_classic()
```

`labs()` can actually rename many more texts like colour, subtitle, caption, ...

---

# Statistics and Special Effects

Instead of creating summaries inside the data frame object, ggplot has some function to calculate and display them automatically.

The first special effect is the `geom_smooth()` layer. `geom_smooth()` is a classic geometry layer but which displays linear and non-linear trends.

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=12}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, nrow = 1) +
  theme_classic()
```

---

# Statistics and Special Effects

`geom_smooth()` has one important extra argument called `method`. If method has the value __"lm"__, a linear regression will be shown. If method has the value __"loess"__ or __"gam"__, a non-linear regression will be shown.

```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=12}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, nrow = 1) +
  theme_classic()
```

---

# Additional Options

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=12}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2, size = 1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, nrow = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1960, 1980, 2000)) +
  labs(
    x = "Year (from 1952 to 2007)",
    y = "Life Expectancy",
    title = "Evolution of life expectancy from 1952 to 2007 per continent."
  ) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) +
  guides(color ="none")
```

---

# Map Visualisations

If used for the first run the following code to use the function `map_data()`

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("maps")
```

To do a Map visualisation with {ggplot2}, we __need the longitude and latitude__ of each country. Then, these variables need to be joined to the original data that we want to display on the map. `geom_polygon()` will use these variables to draw the countries' borders.

For example, let's display the population for each country in 2007:

```{r fig.show="hide"}
pop_2007 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007)

map_world <- map_data("world") 

map_pop_2007 <- full_join(map_world, pop_2007, by = c("region" = "country"))

ggplot(data = map_pop_2007) +
  aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = pop) +
  geom_polygon()
```

---

# Map Visualisations

```{r  fig.height=5, fig.width=12}
ggplot(data = map_pop_2007) +
  aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = pop) +
  geom_polygon()
```

---

# Map Visualisations

```{r maps, fig.height=7, fig.width=12, fig.show="hide"}
ggplot(data = map_pop_2007) +
  aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = pop) +
  geom_polygon() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "yellow", high = "red", na.value = "grey") +
  labs(
    title = "Differences between countries regarding their population in 2007",
    subtitle = "Countries in grey have no data due to a mismatch with their names",
    caption = "Source: R package {gapminder}",
    x = "Longitude",
    y = "Latitude",
    fill = "Country Population"
  ) +
  theme_bw()
```

---

# Map Visualisations

```{r, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(fig_chunk("maps", "png"))
```

## Exercise

Build a ggplot with the `gapminder` dataset and one `aes()` layer which contains the x as `continent`, y as `lifeExp` and color as `continent`. Use `geom_boxplot()` as geometry and `year` as a facet variable, use a theme of your choice as well and changes axises labels:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(...
```

Build a ggplot with the `gapminder` dataset and:

- One `geom_line()` layer which contains the x as `year`, y as `lifeExp` and group as `country` in its `aes()`,
- One `geom_smooth()` layer which contains the x as `year`, y as `lifeExp` and color as `continent` in its `aes()` ,
- One `facet_wrap()` for each continent.

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(_ _ _) +
  geom_line(aes(_ _ _)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(_ _ _)) +
  facet_wrap(_ _ _) 
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 10, warn_when = 60)

# 3. Combine ggplot() and Pipes

---

# Combine ggplot() and Pipes

A very powerful way to create figures in R is to use a __ggplot at the end of a data transformation pipe__.

Indeed, having a data frame object as first argument of the `ggplot()` function is similar to using a pipe operator and chaining it to the `ggplot()` function:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# this classic representation:
ggplot(data = gapminder) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)
  geom_point()

# is the same as:
gapminder %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent) +
  geom_point()

# is the same as:
gapminder %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_point()
```

The layers are still added with the `+` symbol.

---

# filter() to ggplot()

You can easily display only the data for a specific section of you interest. For example, let's filter the data only for Ireland:

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=12}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "Ireland") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, lifeExp, color = country)) +
  geom_line()
```

---

# mutate() to ggplot()

If you need to display a variable that has to be created beforehand, you can always include a mutate statement in the chain.

For example, let's create the variable `gdpPercountry` which is the result of the multiplication between countries' population and countries' gdpPercap. Then let's display this information for Ireland and France:

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=12}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdpPercountry = gdpPercap*pop) %>% 
  filter(country == "Ireland") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(gdpPercountry, lifeExp, color = country)) +
  geom_line()
```

---

# summarise() to ggplot()

Finally, one of the most useful possibilities will be to summarise variables per groups and to display this information in figures.

For example, let's create the average population per continent and display how this average evolves with time:

```{r fig.height=3.5, fig.width=12}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(year, continent) %>% 
  summarise(m_pop = mean(pop)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, m_pop, color = continent)) +
  geom_line()
```

---

# summarise() to ggplot()

We can also compare the sum of the population by continent for the year 2007:

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=12}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarise(s_pop = sum(pop)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(continent, s_pop, fill = continent)) +
  geom_col()
```
