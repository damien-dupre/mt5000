We have seen how to use Power BI for basic Reports and Dashboards

Now is the time to learn a much **more powerful** and much **more complicated** tool...

# 1. Around Tableau

---

# What is Tableau?

Tableau Software is an interactive data visualization software company focused on business intelligence:

- Created in 2003
- Acquired by Salesforce 2019

Tableau is a set of different product which aims to create interactive data visualisation dashboard.

Among these product, you will find:

- **Tableau Prep** (dedicated to cleaning data - no use here)
- **Tableau Desktop** (the main software - not free but can be access with a student license)
- **Tableau Public** (exact same a Tableau Desktop but free and the only way to save your work is by publishing dashboard online)
- **Tableau Server & Tableau Online** (alternative to Tableau Desktop without local installation)

---

# How to Use Tableau Public

1. Go to https://public.tableau.com
2. Sign in
3. Enjoy full features of Tableau Desktop (except saving file, only public publication online)

# 2. Tableau Overview

---

# Tableau in a Nutshell

Tableau is very similar to Power BI but it actually simpler in its structure (but the visualisation capabilities are more complex):

There are 4 types of areas:

- **Data Source** is where you check the type of variables and where you can do basic transformations
- **Worksheet** is where you build each individual visualisation (1 worksheet per visualisation)
- **Dashboard** is where you combine all the visualisations in 1 interactive page
- **Story** is where you create interactive presentation with multiple slides (no use here)

# Tableau Worksheet

```

---

# Tableau Dashboard

```{r out.width='100%'}
include_img("tableau_dashboard.png")
```

---

# Tableau Story 

```{r out.width='100%'}
include_img("tableau_story.png")
```

---

# Principles

Tableau is only about:
- Dragging & dropping from variable list to plot (no-code software) 
- Selecting the right data summary
- Creating independent figures and organising them on a page

```

# 3. Connect Data in Tableau

---

# Files or Connectors?

Without being too complicated, there is two major ways to connect data in Tableau:
- From a File which won't be modified
- From a database through a connector (i.e., interface) to obtained data stored on a remote server (e.g., [Covid Dashboards](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/covid-19-viz-gallery))

**Files** can be of format .csv, .xls, .xlsx, .json, ...

**Databases** cloud hosted on google drive or with OData protocol (url access to the data)

# Connect to Multiple Data

It is possible to add more than one file but it can be done with or without joining the data.

- If you join the two or more data source, you will be able to use variables from different files in the same visualisation. However, a relationship between the data has to be established.
- If you don't join the data, the variables from each data will have to be used separately in different visualisations.

---

# Joining Multiple Data

.pull-left[
Connect your first data file/database
In the Data Source window, beside Connections, click on the plus sign to "Connect to Data"
] 

.pull-right[
```{r out.width='100%'}
include_img("tableau_connect_join_1.png")
```
]

.pull-left[
Drag and drop the second file next to the box representing the first file
] 

.pull-right[
```{r out.width='100%'}
include_img("tableau_connect_join_2.png")
```
]

---

# Joining Multiple Data

Set the variables to join and if the link between the data files is correct then the link will be green

```{r out.width='100%'}
include_img("tableau_connect_join_3.png")
```

---

# Add Different Data

.pull-left[
Instead of clicking on the plus sign beside Connections, you can add data by clicking on the database symbol.
] 

.pull-right[
```{r out.width='100%'}
include_img("tableau_add_data_1.png")
```
]

However you won't be able to use variable from both source for the same visualisation:

```{r out.width='30%'}
include_img("tableau_add_data_2.png")
```

## Exercise

From the loop page, on the tile "Lecture Data", use the files **organisation alpha details**, **organisation alpha salary 2017**, **organisation alpha salary 2018**, and **organisation alpha salary 2019** and join them in Tableau Public.

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 5, warn_when = 60)

]

.pull-right[
**Dimensions = Categorical Variables**

- Made of character string (most of the time)
- Can be numeric if refers to an ID

**Measures = Continuous Variables**

- Made of numbers
- Special cases of **Measure Names**, and **Measure Values**
]

# Analytics Tab

# Plot Configuration

```
]

.pull-right[
Equivalent to Excel Pivot Table but for visualisations

- **Columns** = X axis
- **Rows** = Y axis
- **Pages** = 1 plot per values (categories)
- **Filters** = Keep specific values
- **Marks** = Design of representation
  - Colors
  - Size
  - Texts
  - ...

- Scatterplots
- Box plots
- ...
]

# Aggregation Method

When selected as Rows or Columns, double click/click left on a Measure variable (green variable)

.pull-left[
Choose between:
  - Dimensions (raw data, equivalent of "Don't summarize" in PowerBI)
  - Measure (COUNT, AVERAGE, STD, ...)

.right-column[
Remember, there is a type of visualisation for each type of variables:

- **Composition** (i.e. bar/column and pie charts) for **1 Dimension** (i.e., categorical variable)

- **Distribution** (i.e. histogram, density, box plot and dynamite charts) for **1 Measure** (i.e., continuous variable)

- **Comparison** for **2 Dimensions** or for **1 Dimension** and **1 Measure**

- **Relationship** (i.e. scatterplot with regression line) for **2 Measures**

## Distribution Figures

---

# Distribution Figures

Like for Power BI, Tableau is lacking some distribution figures:

- Histograms are fully implemented by default
- Density plots are not possible
- Box plots are fully implemented by default
- Dynamite plots can be done with average bar chart but without error bars

```{r out.width='100%'}
include_graphics("https://preview.redd.it/0esbxbu1tpg61.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9340f0f2c8d9a8a6286bceaa88314b6ae5bbebb4")

```

---

# Distribution Figures

```{r out.width='100%'}
include_img("tableau_average_bar.gif")
```

---
class: title-slide, middle

## Comparison Figures

---

# Comparison Figures

Comparison Figures can be easily done by adding "Dimension" as colour, column or row variable to any of the previous figures:

- Bar/Pie charts using CNT aggregation
- Histograms
- Box plots
- Bar charts with AVG aggregation

---

# Comparison Figures

```{r out.width='100%'}

```

---

# Comparison Figures

# Comparison Figures

```

---

# Comparison Figures

```{r out.width='100%'}
include_img("tableau_comparison_4.png")
```

---
class: title-slide, middle

## Relationship Figures

---

# Relationship Figures

The scatterplot is the best way to display the relationship between 2 **Measure** variables

However, it is essential to use the **Dimension** option from both axes menu instead of the default Sum for aggregation

A trend line can be added from the **Analytics** option.

# Relationship Figures

# 6. Tableau Dashboard

---

# Tableau Dashboard

Like in Power BI, a dashboard is obtained by dropping several "Sheets"/Vizualisations on a page, by organising their position, and by adding additional elements (i.e., text, image, ...).

Design features can be modified in order to give the dashboard a professional feel.

Interactive customisations can be added from the Dashboard for all the "Sheets"/Visualisations to move simultaneously (next lecture).

# 7. Tableau Practice

# Titanic Dataset

```{r out.width='100%'}
include_graphics("http://user-images.strikinglycdn.com/res/hrscywv4p/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,h_2000,q_90,w_1200/107158/Screen_Shot_2015-08-03_at_1.57.45_AM_ibp1u8.png")
```

Variables:
- Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
- Passenger Class (1st; 2nd; 3rd)
- Name, Sex, Age, Cabin
- sibsp - Nb of Siblings/Spouses Aboard
- parch - Nb of Parents/Children Aboard
- ticket - Ticket Number
- fare - Passenger Fare
- embarked - Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

---
class: title-slide, middle

## From the loop page, use **titanic.csv** to create a Tableau Dashboard

Create: 
- **1 Pie Chart using Survival**
- **1 Bar Chart Proportion using Survival, Sex and Embarked**
- **1 Scatterplot using Fare, Age and Survival**

Remember to **use titles**, to **customise them** and to **add a text** to convey your narrative

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 20, warn_when = 60)
```
