# Previoulsy ...

We have seen how to create clear and efficient figures:

- Pie Chart
- Bar Plot
- Density Plot
- Histogram Plot
- Dynamite Plot
- Scatterplot

Based on basic statistical calculations:
- Count
- Proportion
- Median/Quartiles
- Mean/Standard Deviation
- Correlation

# Mastering Tableau

Tableau is much more than basic visualisations, very professional output can be obtained easily, see some examples online: https://public.tableau.com/gallery/

- Use these existing dashboards as inspirations for your own dashboards. Don't reinvent the wheel, reproducing with your own data is challenging enough. 

- Follow the steps of Mehmet, student of MT5000 in 2020, selected among the top 10 of [EDHEC DataViz Challenge](https://www.edhec.edu/en/edhec-dataviz-challenge)

Past challenges are an excellent way to have an idea of outstanding dashboards:
- [Google Data Viz Challenge (2012)]( https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/big-data-viz-challenge-entries)
- [Big Data Viz Challenge (2016)]( https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/big-data-viz-challenge)
- [Do Good Data Viz Challenge (2016)](https://www.tableau.com/tableau-foundation-challenge)
- [Women in Analytics Data Viz Competition (2020)](https://womeninanalytics.com/data-viz-competition/)

Coming Soon:
- Iron Viz (2021) https://www.tableau.com/community/iron-viz
- Data VizArt Student Challenge (2021) https://dvastudentchallenge.ca/

# Going Forward

In general, through the lecture we have seen variables:
- Made of character strings (usually interpreted as categorical but not always)
- Made of numbers (usually interpreted as continuous but not always)

But variables can be made of many more values. In Business Analytics are particularly important: Locations and Dates. **How to manipulate Location and Date type variables in Tableau?**

--

Tableau is well implanted in organisation because of the multiple data type that can be process, we will have a closer look at **how to access different data type in Tableau?**

--

Tableau is not limited to data visualisations, some data transformations can also be done, let's see **why doing your transformations in Tableau and how?**

--

Finally, the export or publication of Tableau dashboard can be tricky, we will see **how to share your dashboard for the assignment and in general?**

# 1. Location and Date types in Tableau

---

# Space and Time Variables

For the moment we were only interested in two variable types:

- Categorical (made of characters) also called "Dimension" in Tableau
- Continuous (made of numbers) also called "Measures" in Tableau

However, we have seen that sometimes...

- A Categorical variable needs to be converted to Continuous (e.g., Opinion scales)
- A Continuous variable needs to be converted to Categorical (e.g., Survived 0/1 in titanic)

> In Tableau change the type of a variable by drag-drop in the list of variables "Dimensions" or "Measures"

--

.pull-left[
In addition to Categorical and Continuous variables, Tableau has special features to handle **Location** type and **Date** type variable.

# Location Type Variables

Is a list of geographical localisation by:
- Continents (Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania, North America, South America)
- Country (Ireland, France, Spain, Germany, ...)
- States, Regions, Counties, Cities ... 

By default, location variables should be properly encoded. A blue globe icon should appear before the variable.

But if Locations are encoded as a Categorical (if made of characters) or Continuous variable (if made of numbers), you need to give this variable a **Geographic Role**

```{r out.width='40%'}
include_graphics("https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/Img/maps_getstarted6.gif")
```

---

# Mapping with Tableau

To create a data visualisation map:

1. Drag and drop the **location variable in the row/column** of the main worksheet
2. Use **Show Me** and select one of the Map type figure (Longitude/Latitude variables are automatically generated)
  - Symbol map (data reduced to a point - good for cities)
  - Maps (data fill the full shape of the location)
3. Drag and drop in the **Color box of Marks** another variable to display changes in values according to location for this variable

```{r out.width='60%'}
include_graphics("https://tutorialgateway.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/Maps-in-Tableau-5.png")
```

# Date Type Variables

Is a variable referring to a specific time, it can be any combination and format including year, month, day, minute, second, ...

For example, "March 23, 1984", "03/23/84", "23/03/1984", "1984-03-23" have different formats but refer to the date.

In data science we use the ISO 8601 international standard format (%Y-%m-%d) which corresponds to "1984-03-23" (format allow to sort date easily)

By default, date variables should be properly encoded. A blue calendar icon should appear before the variable.

But if Dates are encoded as a Categorical (if made of characters) or Continuous variable (if made of numbers), you need to convert this variable as **Date** or as **Date & Time**

---

# Line and Area Charts

Date variables are usually used as X axis (Column Field in Tableau) to display the evolution of another variable according the time.

The resolution of the chart can be adjusted by clicking on the + symbol before the Date variable

```{r out.width='60%'}
include_graphics("https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/Img/datefunctions3.png")
```

---

# Line and Area Charts

While the Date variable is in one field, drag and drop the other variable in the other field.

It uses a statistical aggregation for this second variable. By default it is the Sum (see SUM) but it can be changed to Count, Proportion, Median, Mean, ...

To add a second line in the same plot using the original Date variable:
1. Drag and drop this second variable in the row or column field next to the first one
2. Then, drag and drop this second variable in actual axis to merge

```{r out.width='60%'}
include_graphics("https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/Img/line_8.png")
```

# 2. Data Transformation in Tableau

---

# Data Transformation in Tableau

If your data is a Stand Alone File, prefer transformations with MS Excel...

... Except for **pivoting your table** (long vs wide table) or **joining two or more tables**

If your data is an Auto Update document (type cloud hosted spreadsheet or database) then transforming in Tableau is required

Tableau has created a specific tool for data transformation called **Tableau Prep** but a lot can already be done with **Tableau Desktop**

```{r out.width='35%'}
include_graphics("https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/65548459/what-if-i-told-you-you-could-prep-your-data-for-tableau-in-minutes-not-hours.jpg")
```

---

# Pivot in Tableau

Pivot is the action to transform a table from wide (multiple variables) to long (one variable contains names and the second the values)

```{r out.width='80%'}
include_graphics("https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/Img/qs_pivot_example.png")
```

.pull-left[
In Data Source page:

1. Select the variables to pivot
2. Click left/double and use "Pivot"
]

.pull-right[
```{r out.width='80%'}
include_graphics("https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/Img/qs_pivot_command.png")
```
]

---

# Join in Tableau

Join is the action of merging two tables based on a common key variable

.pull-left[

1. Open a second table in Tableau's home page
2. In Data Source page, drag and drop this second table next to the first table 
]

.pull-right[
```{r out.width='80%'}
include_graphics("https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-gb/Img/data_model_single_tablewjoin3.gif")
```
]

Click on the join logo to select which of Inner, Left, Right or Full join you want to do

```{r out.width='80%'}
include_graphics("https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-gb/Img/data_model_single_tablewjoin4.gif")

# 3. Share your Tableau Dashboard

---

# Export vs. Share

Exporting is the process of saving a dashboard in a file that can be read by someone else.

- Export as PowerPoint: Useful to communicate your visualisation to people who doesn't have Tableau but loose the interactivity

- Export as Packaged Workbook: Save the visualisation with the data (.twbx file extension). **Your assignment has to be Exported as Packaged Workbook and uploaded on Loop**

Note if you save as a simple workbook (.twb file extension), it won't be accepted.

--

Sharing is the process of publishing a dashboard online for everyone to access it.

- It is done with an additional account to Tableau Server or to Tableau Online which is quite complicated
- It can be used in your CV as a portfolio of skills in data visualisation and storytelling
