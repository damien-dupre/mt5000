# Brief Introduction

Modern data science uses free and open-source computer languages:

* Proprietary languages (e.g., Matlab) and software (e.g., SPSS, Stata, SAS) are outdated
* Main open-source computer languages for data science are Python and R

While Python is the most used language by computer engineers for web and app development, R has some advantages:

.pull-left[
1. **Easy to write**, to read and to use
2. Focused on **reports and journal papers** with reproducibility
3. Advanced **statistical packages**
4. **Friendly and open** community

### So let's useR!

# 1. R and RStudio

# What are R and RStudio?

There are some key concepts you need to understand and to remember:

* R is the name of the language
* RStudio is the name of the upgraded interface to write R code

R is usually used via RStudio and First time users often confuse the two. At its simplest, **R is like a car’s engine** while **RStudio is like a car’s dashboard**.

# Posit Cloud

In your webrowser (Chrome, Firefox, ...), go to: https://posit.cloud/
  - Sign up
  - In your workspace, Click "new project"

# Code in Rstudio

Most of the R code displayed in this lecture is included in these slides. Rather than typing it manually, open these slides in another tab to copy-paste the code

Two ways to access these slides:

  - From Loop: Lectures Slides > Lecture 8
  - Or from the URL: https://damien-dupre.github.io/mt5000/lectures/lecture_8

```{r out.width='50%'}

```

# 2. Coding in RStudio

---

# RStudio IDE

When you create a new project, you will lauch Rstudio see the following 3 windows (also called panes):

* **Console**: where the results are printed
* **Workspace**: where the objects are stored
* **Files, Plots, Package, Help and Viewer**: where data science materials are

```{r out.width='60%'}
include_graphics("img/rstudio_panes.png")
```

The last window **Code Editor** opens when creating a new R Script

---

# Console: R’s Heart

The console displays 1. **What has been ran**, 2. The **results** (or some parts) of has been ran, and 3. The **status of the R process**.

.pull-left[
The Status of R is indicated by the symbol in the console prompt:

* `>` means ready to process code 
* `+` means incomplete command (escape with <kbd>Esc</kbd>)
* &#128721; at the top right corner means the console is busy processing your code
]

.pull-right[
```{r out.width = '100%'}
include_graphics("img/r_console.png")
```
]

You can execute code by typing it directly into the Console. However, it will not be saved. And if you make a mistake you will have to re-type everything all over again. 

Instead, it is better to **write all your code in a document (R script or Quarto file) in the Code Editor**.

---

# Environment: R’s Brain

The Environment tab of this pane shows you the **names of all the data objects** (like vectors, matrices, and data frames) that you have defined in your current R session. 

You can also see **information** like the number of observations and rows in data objects. 

```{r out.width='100%'}
include_graphics("https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/envir1.png")
```

---

# Files / Plots / Packages / Help

* The **Files** panel gives you access to the file directory on your hard drive.

* The **Plots** panel shows all your plots. There are buttons for opening the plot in a separate window and exporting the plot as a pdf or jpeg.

* The **Packages** shows a list of all the R packages installed on the local or remote machine and indicates whether or not they are currently loaded.

* With the **Help** menu for R functions you can access to essential information to use them. Just have a look at some of them by typling <kbd>F1</kbd> with the cursor on the function, using the `help()` function, or by typing `?` followed by the function name such as:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
help(seq)
?seq
help(lm)
?lm
```

---

# Code Editor: R's Nervous System

- It makes the link between all the previous pane and allows to reproduce actions and behaviours.

- You can open as many R Script / Quarto file as you want.

- These documents are the only documents that have to be saved. No need to save you data, figures and calculations as you can reproduce them every time instantaneously with the code.

- Save your eyes and look like a nerd by changing the code's appearance

# 3. The Basics of R Code

---

# What are .R and .qmd files?

**.R** is the extension for a R script (document including only R code): 
- Click **File > New File > R Script** in RStudio
- Includes only code which can be active or inactive (line starts with `#`)
- Used for code testing

Example of non-active code

```{r echo=TRUE}
# non active code
```

Example of active code

```{r echo=TRUE}
paste("active", "code")
1 + 1 # everything after `#` is non active and is used for comments
```

---

# What are .R and .qmd files?

**.qmd** is the extension for a Quarto file: 
- Click **File > New File > Quarto document...** in RStudio
- Refers to a document that includes code and text
- Generates a specific type of output
  - .html (web page, slides, books, and dashboards)
  - .pdf (Academic LaTex papers and reports)
  - .doc (MS Word documents)

# How to Run R Code?



.pull-left[
In a R Script, place your cursor anywhere on the line you want to run and either:
- Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> & <kbd>Enter</kbd> (Win)
- Press <kbd>command</kbd> & <kbd>Enter</kbd> (Mac)
- Click the `Run` button on RStudio's interface

In a Quarto file:
- Use the **green** arrow to run the current chunk of code
- Use the `Knit` button on RStudio's interface to create the output file

# What are R packages?

R packages extend the functionality of R. They are written by a worldwide community of R users and can be downloaded for free from the internet.

A good analogy for **R packages are like apps you can download onto a mobile phone**.

.pull-left[
.center[R: A new phone]
```{r out.width='100%'}
include_graphics("img/phone_design.jpeg")
```

.pull-right[
.center[R Packages: Apps you can download]
```{r out.width='100%'}
include_graphics("img/phone_apps.jpeg")
```
]

---

# What are R packages?

Say you have purchased a new phone, to use Instagram you need to **install the app once** and to **open the app** every time you want to use it.

The process is very similar for using an R package. You need to:

* **Install the package** with the function `install.packages()`.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("praise")
```

* **“Load” the package** with the function `library()`. 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(praise)
```

Once the package is loaded you can use all the functions from this package such as:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
praise()
```

class: title-slide, middle

## Exercise

Open a R Script in RStudio. In this document:
- Use line 1 to **install the package "praise"**
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("praise")
```
- Use line 2 to **load the library praise**
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(praise)
```
- Use line 3 to **run the function `praise()`** as it is, without arguments
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
praise()
```

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 5, warn_when = 60)
```

---

# Calling Functions

Functions are algorithms (or lines of code) which **transform data to something else**. For example, the function `lm()`, uses data to compute the result of a linear regression model.
 
Functions have **a name** and **several arguments** that require some information.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
function_name(argument_1 = value_1, argument_2 = value_2, ...)
```

For example, the function `seq()` makes a sequences of numbers:
* The first argument `from` is the number starting the sequence
* The second argument `to` is last number of the sequence

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
seq(from = 1, to = 10)
```

`r faa("exclamation-triangle", animate="flash", speed="slow", color="red")` Arguments doesn't need to be explicitly called, they can also be matched by position:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
seq(1, 10)
```

---

# Assign Values to Objects in R

Usually the arguments of functions expects an Object name to access the data.

An object is a box that **can include anything** (e.g., values, dataframes, figures, models, functions, ...) and **has a name** that you have to choose. 

--

To create an object, you need to **assign something** to a name using the `<-` operator. If you type the name of the object, R will print out its content.

```{r echo=TRUE}
x <- 4
x
seq(x, 10)
```

---

# Assign Values to Objects in R

It is very important to distinguish values and objects in R:

```{r}
tribble(
                  ~Type,            ~Class,                        ~Example, 
               "Number",   "Numeric Value",                     "1, 2, ...",
     "Word with quotes", "Character Value",             '"one", "two", ...',
  "Word without quotes",     "Object Name", "function name, data name, ..."
  ) |>
  kable(format = "html")
```

These types of values are then stored in different objects:

```{r out.width='50%'}
include_graphics("http://r.qcbs.ca/workshop01/workshop01-en/images/matrix.png")
```

---

# Different R Objects

All object assignments have the same form:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
object_name <- object_content
```

You want your object names to be descriptive, so you will need a convention for multiple words. I recommend **snake_case** where you separate lower-case words with `_`.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
numeric_value <- 1

character_value <- "one"

vectors_with_numeric_values <- c(1, 2)

vectors_with_character_values <- c("one", "two")

dataframe_example <- data.frame(col1 = c("one", "two"), col2 = c(1, 2))

dataframe_example <- data.frame(
  col1 = vectors_with_character_values, 
  col2 = vectors_with_numeric_values
  )
```

# 4. Access Data in Posit Cloud

---

# Open your Data as R Object (1)

Posit Cloud is a free remote computer, the computing is not run on your computer.

To open Data on Posit Cloud, you first need to `Upload` your file on this computer and to `Import` the data in R.

.pull-left[
.center[Step 1: Upload your File]
```{r out.width='100%'}
include_graphics("https://community-cdn.rstudio.com/uploads/default/original/2X/9/91a128299a9d910f84279be9ecd89b60aa15f20b.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
.center[Step 2: Import your Data]
```{r out.width='100%'}
include_graphics("img/rstudio_import.png")
```
]

Remember that **.csv files are basically text files**

---

# Open your Data as R Object (2)

For early beginners on the Desktop version, directly open data with RStudio 's `Import Dataset` button.

```{r out.width='70%'}
include_graphics("https://support.rstudio.com/hc/article_attachments/360017333414/data-import-rstudio-overview.gif")
```

If you see your data in the preview, you can click `Import` to create an object containing your data. A code will be executed on the console, **Copy and Paste the first line of this code in your R script**. You will not have to do it manually once the code is in your script.

---

# Open your Data as R Object (3)

To ensure code reproducibility, open data with the appropriate function (e.g., `read.csv()` for csv files).

The main argument of these functions is `file` which corresponds to the path to a file, followed by the name of the file and it extension:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Windows
my_file_object <- read.csv(file = "C:/path/to/my/file.csv")
my_file_object <- read.csv("C:/path/to/my/file.csv")

# Macos
my_file_object <- read.csv(file = "/Users/path/to/my/file.csv")
my_file_object <- read.csv("/Users/path/to/my/file.csv")
```

The following codes will generate an error:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Incomplete path
my_file_object <- read.csv("/path/to/my/file.csv")
# Missing file extension
my_file_object <- read.csv("C:/path/to/my/file")
# Use of backward slash
my_file_object <- read.csv("C:\path\to\my\file.csv")
```

# 5. Save Your Data

---

# Save Your Data

Usually, **only R Script file (.R) or Quarto file (.qmd) have to be saved** as they allow the full replicability of transformations and result.

However, if you want to use the data that have been transformed, joined or pivoted, a function has to be used according the type of export.

The simplest export is a .csv file with the function `write.csv()`. It as two main arguments:
- `x` which is the name of the object to save
- `file` which is the name of the output file

Note: don't forget the file extension in the argument `file`

Example:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Saved in the current directory
write.csv(x = my_file_object, file = "my_file_name.csv")
write.csv(my_file_object, "my_file_name.csv")

# Saved in the directory you prefer
write.csv(my_file_object, "C:/path/to/my/my_file_name.csv") # Windows
write.csv(my_file_object, "/Users/path/to/my/my_file_name.csv") # Macos
```

---
class: title-slide, middle

## Exercise

Save the data contained in the object "unicef_metadata" in a new .csv file (give a different name than "unicef_metadata.csv" else this document will be overwritten)

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 3, warn_when = 60)
```
