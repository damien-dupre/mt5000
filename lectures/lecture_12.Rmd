# Objectives

The last tool for data analytics and visualisations displayed in this lectures is called **GitHub**.

GitHub has a lot of different functions. For now, we will only see how to use it to **published the html document output from our Quarto file**.

# What is GitHub

Primary used to collaborate on code development, it became multi-purpose:

- Version Control
- File and Code Storage
- Collaboration
- Developers Social Media
- Online Publication & Website Host
- Automatic Actions

And even more that I am not aware of!

# GitHub Repository

# How does GitHub Work?

The core principle of GitHub is a remote desktop (or profile) with a folder called **Repository** (or "Repo" if you want to be in) for each project you are working on or you worked on.

```{r}
include_graphics("img/github_dd_profile.png")

## Exercise

Follow the steps here after to **create your first repository**.

---

# GitHub Repositories

[To create a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo):

1/ In the upper-right corner of any page, use the `+` drop-down menu, and select New repository.

```{r}
include_graphics("https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-11427/mw-1000/images/help/repository/repo-create.webp")
```

# GitHub Repositories

```{r}
include_graphics("https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/newrepoform.png")
```

---

# GitHub Repositories

2/ **Type a short, memorable name** for your repository. For example, "hello-world".

```{r}
include_graphics("https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-25139/mw-1000/images/help/repository/create-repository-name.webp")
```

.pull-left[
3/ **Optionally**, add a description of your repository. For example, "My first repository on GitHub." 
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
include_graphics("https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-26377/mw-1000/images/help/repository/create-repository-desc.webp")
```
]

# GitHub Commit

# Always Commit Changes

In GitHub, a commit is a saved change to a project's source code or other files. When you make changes to a file in a GitHub repository, you create a new version of that file. **Once you're ready to save those changes, you create a commit**.

**A commit contains a snapshot of the changes** you've made to one or more files, along with a message that describes the changes. This **message should be descriptive and clear**, so that other developers can understand what changes you've made and why.

Committing your changes to GitHub is an important part of collaborating with others on a project, as it allows other developers to **see what changes you've made** and merge them into the main project. Commits also make it easy to revert changes if necessary, since you can always go back to a previous commit in the project's history.

> Everytime you want to take into account a change in your repository, you need to commit these changes

## Exercise

When you created your new repository, you initialized it with a README file. README files are a great place to describe your project in more detail, or add some documentation such as how to install or use your project. The contents of your README file are automatically shown on the front page of your repository.

**Follow the steps here after to commit a change to the README file.**

---

# Commit the First Change

1/ In your repository's list of files, **click README.md**. 

```{r out.width='50%'}
include_graphics("https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-44661/mw-1000/images/help/repository/create-commit-open-readme.webp")
```

---

# Commit the First Change

2/ In the upper right corner of the file view, **click the pen icon to open the file editor**.

```{r out.width='80%'}
include_graphics("https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-90977/mw-1000/images/help/repository/edit-file-edit-button.webp")
```

3/ In the text box, **type some information about the project**.

4/ Above the new content, click **Preview**.

```{r out.width='80%'}
include_graphics("https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-66827/mw-1000/images/help/repository/edit-readme-preview-changes.webp")
```

---

# Commit the First Change

.pull-left[
5/ **Review the changes** you made to the file. You will see the new content in green.

6/ Click **Commit changes...**

7/ In the "Commit message" field, type a short, meaningful **commit message** that describes the change you made to the file. 
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
include_graphics("https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-33561/mw-1000/images/help/repository/create-commit-review.webp")
```
]

8/ Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. Select **commit directly to the `main` branch** for now. 

`r faa("exclamation-triangle", animate="flash", speed="slow", color="red")` Warning: For collaborative projects never commit to the main branch

9/ Click **Propose file change**.

## Exercise

**Fill you Repository up with the files** created when Rendering Quarto to html by following the steps described here after

---

# Fill up your Repository

0/ (Only if you are using Rstudio in Posit cloud) **Export your Rstudio project folder from Posit cloud to your computer** and **unzip this folder on your computer**

```{r}
include_graphics("img/posit_cloud_export_project.gif")
```

---

# Fill up your Repository

1/ In your Repository Page in GitHub, Click **Add files** then **Upload files**

2/ **Drop your entire unzipped folder** in the main box and **commit your changes**

```{r}

# GitHub Pages

# GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a **web hosting service** offered by GitHub that allows you to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository. This means you can use GitHub to store and version control your website's code, and then host it for free using GitHub Pages.

GitHub Pages supports several **different types of websites, including personal or project pages**, documentation, blogs, and more. You can use custom domains or subdomains for your website, and GitHub Pages also supports HTTPS encryption for secure communication.

To create a GitHub Pages website, you need to have a GitHub account and a r**epository containing your website's HTML, CSS, and other files**. Once you've created your repository and pushed your website's files to it, you can e**nable GitHub Pages in the repository settings**. Your website will then be published at a URL based on your GitHub username and repository name (e.g., username.github.io/repository).

1/ Go to **Settings** and find **Pages** on the left pane

2/ In **Branch**, instead of None select **Main** and click **Save**

3/ Click on **Actions** and wait that "pages build and deployment" finishes. When it's done, go to **https://username.github.io/repository/**
