# Assessment Structure

### 3 Continuous Assessments

A dataset will be send to you by email. To prevent copying the results, each dataset will have different values and will lead to different results. With this dataset, you will perform each of the 3 assignments:

#### 1. Tableau Dashboard (40%) - Deadline 24/03/2021

*Using the software Tableau, design a professional data dashboard aiming to communicate a message*

#### 2. Statistical Report (40%) - Deadline 14/04/2021

*Using the software Jamovi, write an academic research paper testing hypotheses that you will define and reporting their statistical results*

#### 3. R Notebook Analysis (20%) - Deadline 28/04/2021

*Using R and RStudio, reproduce the results presented in the tableau dashboard and in the statistical report with a Rmarkdown notebook*

# Assessment Structure

### Note

- Each assignment instruction will be uploaded on loop after the deadline of the previous assignment.
- Please submit professional outputs, as I'm not expecting student's approximative work any more.
- Please avoid any form of plagiarism, copy-pasting or group collaborations. I will easily spot rephrased sentences, similar figure design and code sharing.

# Targets

- Short Term: Success in MT5000 assignments

- Mid Term: Success in all other DCU lectures (academic data analytics style and conventions)

- Long Term: Professional data analytic expertise (CV optimised with essential data analytics skills)

### Learning Outcomes

1. Have insight into the concepts and role of big data and data analytics in business and in management decision making

2. Understand, evaluate and apply quantitative academic research methods, tools and techniques

3. Understand, interpret and design professional data visualisation outputs and professional data analytics reports
