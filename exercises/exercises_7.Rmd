# Task: Check if your previous analyses were satisfying the conditions to apply linear models

Investigate your previous analyses on whether **if passenger's gender and age had an influence on their the fares of their tickets** by checking if your previous analyses were satisfying the conditions to apply linear models:

1. Linearity (of the effects)
2. Normality (of the residuals)
3. Homogeneity (of the residuals) 
4. Independence (of observations)

In addition, identify the collinearity of the predictors and potential anomalous data.
