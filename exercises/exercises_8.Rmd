# Task: Replicate the steps shown in the end of Tutorial 8 to obtain a report using the Titanic.csv data

In RStudio Cloud:

1. Create a new R Markdown file
2. Change the title, add the author and the date
3. Load the packages needed in the first code chunk: tidyverse and knitr (install them if not already installed)
4. Upload the titanic.csv file, import the file in the environment and copy-paste the code obtained in the first chunk
5. In the second chunk, display a summary of the dataset with the function `summary()`
6. Use `ggplot()` to create a scatterplot of the relationship between fares and age
7. Describe this analysis in plain text (a couple of sentences is enough)
