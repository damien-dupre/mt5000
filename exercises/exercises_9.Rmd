# Task: Replicate the steps shown in the end of Tutorial 9 to obtain a report using the Titanic.csv data

If possible, use the file created in the Tutorial 8. If not, in RStudio Cloud:

1. Create a new R Markdown file
2. Change the title, add the author and the date
3. Load the packages needed in the first code chunk: tidyverse and knitr (install them if not already installed)
4. Upload the titanic.csv file, import the file in the environment and copy-paste the code obtained in the first chunk
5. In the second chunk, summarise the variable Fare according to the variable Sex according to mean and standard deviation. Then, display a table with the function `kbl()` from the package {kableExtra}
