TITLE: Titanic: “women and children first” or “every man for himself”?

INTRODUCTION: The sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912 is one of the most well-known maritime disasters in history, and it raised profound moral and ethical questions about human behaviour in life-threatening situations. In our exploration of the Titanic disaster, we will employ the power of data analytics to uncover the answer to this pressing question - whether the noble principle of "women and children first" prevailed, or whether the grim reality of "every man for himself" took hold during those fateful moments on the ill-fated ship. Through a meticulous analysis of historical data, we aim to shed light on the choices made by passengers and crew, providing valuable insights into the human dynamics that unfolded on the night the Titanic met its tragic end.

PIE CHART: This visualisation provides a quick snapshot of the overall survival rate. The size of the "Survived" slice compared to the "Did Not Survive" slice paints a vivid picture of the tragic events that unfolded on that fateful night.

BAR CHART:This chart serves as a powerful tool to understand the impact of gender and embarkation location on the likelihood of survival. For the "Sex" variable, we use two bars representing males and females. By comparing the heights of these bars, we can discern any gender-based discrepancies in survival rates. This analysis can potentially reveal whether there was a "women and children first" policy during the evacuation. The "Embarked" variable presents a similar opportunity for exploration. We use bars for each port of embarkation (e.g., Southampton, Cherbourg, and Queenstown) to visualise how the location where a passenger boarded the Titanic might have affected their chances of survival. This bar chart helps us see the significant differences in survival rates based on these two factors.

SCATTERPLOT: This chart plots individual passengers as data points, with each point representing a passenger's fare, age, and their survival status. On the x-axis, we have "Fare," which can provide insight into whether passengers who paid higher fares had a better chance of survival. A trend where survivors paid higher fares could indicate that passengers in higher classes had priority during the evacuation. The y-axis is dedicated to "Age," helping us understand if there was any correlation between age and survival. We might uncover whether children and the elderly had a better chance of survival. The colour of each data point represents the survival status, distinguishing between those who survived and those who did not. This colour-coded scheme makes it easier to see patterns and trends. By examining this scatterplot, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of how factors like fare, age, and survival are interrelated. Do these variables tell a story of survival strategy, economic class, or human behaviour during the Titanic disaster?

CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the visualisations created using the Titanic dataset tell a gripping story of the tragic events that transpired on that fateful night. From the initial pie chart depicting overall survival rates to the detailed bar chart and scatterplot exploring the interplay of survival with factors like sex, embarkation, age, and fare, this visual journey offers a comprehensive look into the factors that influenced the passengers' chances of surviving the Titanic's sinking.
